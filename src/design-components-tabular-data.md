We use tabular data to display 2 or more lists of content where each list item is directly comparable.
This is an early stage pattern and needs more work. At the moment, it really only works for 2 columns of short content.
The table columns donâ€™t stack on top of each other on mobile.

#### Example
<div class="example">
  <img src="assets/units/table.png " alt="Info callout">
</div>
