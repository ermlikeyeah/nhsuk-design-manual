We use binary lists to display 2 related lists of content. These are displayed in a 2 column layout on
large viewports. We stack one on top of the other on smaller viewports.

#### Example in a large viewport
<div class="example">
  <img src="assets/components/binary-list-lg.png" alt="Binary list in large viewport">
</div>

#### Example in a small viewport
<div class="example">
  <img src="assets/components/binary-list-sm.png " alt="Binary list in small viewport">
</div>
