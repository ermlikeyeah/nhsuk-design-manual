Media components are self-contained items of content displayed in a grid layout. We use them mainly to display a
sequence of images with captions. This is an early stage pattern and needs more work.

Media components are arranged in a grid on large viewports.

#### Example
<div class="example">
  <img src="../assets/components/cards/image-cards-lg.png " alt="Media items in large viewport">
</div>  

Media components are stacked on top of each other on small viewports.

##### Example
<div class="example">
  <img src="../assets/components/cards/image-cards-sm.png " alt="Media items in small viewport">
</div>
