We only ever use reveals for progressive disclosure - and only for content that addresses lower priority needs.
We give reveals descriptive titles that clearly explain their contents. We never use reveals to hide content that meets
most usersâ€™ needs, just to make a page shorter for instance.

#### Example
<div class="example">
  <div class="grid-row">
    <img src="assets/components/progressive-reveal-open-lg.png" alt="Progressive reveal open">
  </div>
</div>
