We only ever use reveals for progressive disclosure - and only for content that addresses lower priority needs.
We give reveals descriptive titles that clearly explain their contents. We never use reveals to hide content that meets
most users’ needs, just to make a page shorter for instance.

#### Example
<div class="example">
  <div class="grid-row">
    <img src="../assets/components/progressive-reveal-open-lg.png" alt="Progressive reveal open">
  </div>
</div>
