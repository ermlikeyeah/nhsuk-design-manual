These are links that have higher visual priority than standard text links. Theyâ€™re typically used to access
external services.

#### Example
<div class="example">
  <img src="../assets/components/priority-compact-lg.png" alt="Priority link">
</div>

They can be extended to include extra context. A small amount of text can help define a confusing service,
clarify its worth or show its value.

#### Example
<div class="example">
  <img src="../assets/components/priority-lg.png" alt="Priority link with additional content">
</div>
