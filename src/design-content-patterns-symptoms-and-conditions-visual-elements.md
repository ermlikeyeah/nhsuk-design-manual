### Primary care box (GP, nurse, other services)

We use this for the symptoms that need treatment from a clinician. The easiest way to do this is a bullet list.

Where there is just one symptom or instance that needs treatment from a clinician, we make the whole sentence an H2.

We include other treatment options in the heading. For example:

* seeing a nurse
* using another service

We found that some services, like sexual health clinics, need more context because many users have
preconceptions about them.

Where there is a need we tell users why they should have something checked out. We keep this information to
a minimum so it doesn’t distract users from the main content in the box.

We have a separate section for [treatment from a GP](#example-2-gp-treatment).

<div class="callout callout--info">
  <p>
    <strong>Heading patterns:</strong><br>
    See a [person] if:<br> See a [person] if you: <br>See [person] or go to [service] if:
  </p>
  <p><strong>Link text pattern:</strong><br> Find a [place]</p>
</div>

We are still experimenting with how we direct users to out of hours service.
So far we haven’t seen any specific needs around this.

#### Example 1: see a GP
<div class="example">
  <section class="callout callout--attention">
    <h2>See your GP if:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>your symptoms don’t improve after 7 days</li>
      <li>you’re worried about your child’s symptoms</li>
      <li>you’re 65 or over</li>
      <li>you’re pregnant</li>
      <li>you have a long-term medical condition – for example, diabetes or a heart, lung, kidney or neurological disease</li>
      <li>you have a weakened immune system – for example, because of chemotherapy or HIV</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
</div>

#### Example 2: see a nurse
<div class="example">
  <section class="callout callout--attention">
    <h2>See a nurse in your GP practice if:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>your ear hasn’t cleared after 5 days</li>
      <li>your ear is badly blocked and you can’t hear anything (you can get an infection if it isn’t cleared)</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
</div>

#### Example 3: directing users to different services
<div class="example">
  <section class="callout callout--attention">
    <h2>See a GP or go to a sexual health clinic if:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>you have the symptoms of thrush for the first time</li>
      <li>you’re under 16 or over 60</li>
      <li>your thrush keeps coming back (more than twice in 6 months)</li>
      <li>treatment hasn’t worked</li>
      <li>you’re pregnant or breastfeeding</li>
      <li>you have thrush and a weakened immune system - for example because of diabetes, HIV or chemotherapy</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="callout callout--info">
    <h3>Sexual health clinics can help with thrush</h3>
    <p>Sexual health clinics treat problems with the genitals and urine system.</p>
    <p>
      Many sexual health clinics offer a walk-in service, where you don’t need an appointment.
      They’ll often get test results quicker than GP practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/service-search/Sexual-health-information-and-support/LocationSearch/734">
        Find a sexual health clinic
      </a>
    </p>
  </section>
</div>

#### Example 4: directing users to out of hours service
<div class="example">
  <section class="callout callout--attention">
    <h2 id="see-a-gp-if-you-have">See a GP if you have:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>a high temperature</li>
      <li>swelling around the ear</li>
      <li>fluid coming from the ear</li>
      <li>something stuck in the ear</li>
      <li>an earache for more than 3 days</li>
      <li>hearing loss or a change in hearing</li>
      <li>other symptoms, like vomiting or a severe sore throat</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you can’t get an appointment, contact 111 or go to a
      <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Service-Search/Walk-in%20centre/LocationSearch/663">walk-in centre</a>.
    </p>
  </section>
</div>

### Seeing someone urgently

This is for symptoms that need urgent medical care but not a 999 call.

We use bullet lists that can be easily scanned for keywords.

Where it’s not evident we give a reason why people should act quickly.

We tailor the heading around the specific condition but it needs to clearly say that it’s urgent.

<div class="callout callout--info">
  <p><strong>Heading patterns:</strong><br> See someone urgently if:<br> See a GP now or go to A&E if</p>
</div>

#### Example 1: GP or A&E
<div class="example">
  <section class="callout callout--alert">
    <h2>See a GP now or go to <abbr title="Accident and Emergency">A&amp;E</abbr> if:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>your nosebleed lasts longer than 20 minutes</li>
      <li>the bleeding seems excessive</li>
      <li>you’re swallowing a large amount of blood that makes you vomit</li>
      <li>the bleeding started after a blow to your head</li>
      <li>you’re feeling weak or dizzy</li>
      <li>you’re having difficulty breathing</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
</div>

#### Example 2: urgent GP appointment (no A&E)
<div class="example">
  <section class="callout callout--alert">
    <h2>Ask for an urgent GP appointment if you have:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>pain in your sides or lower back</li>
      <li>a high temperature (fever) of 38C or above</li>
      <li>shivering and chills</li>
      <li>felt sick or been sick</li>
      <li><a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/conditions/diarrhoea">diarrhoea</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>These symptoms suggest a kidney infection, which can be serious if it isn’t treated.</p>
  </section>
</div>

#### Example 3: heading refers to children
<div class="example">
  <section class="callout callout--alert">
    <h2>Take your baby or toddler to the GP urgently if they:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>have a high temperature and you can’t bring it down - over 38C (under 3 months), over 39C (3 to 6 months)</li>
      <li>have blood or mucus in their poo</li>
      <li>have severe tummy pain</li>
      <li>are getting worse quickly</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you can’t get hold of your GP, go to <abbr title="Accident and Emergency">A&amp;E</abbr>.</p>
  </section>
</div>

### Emergency box

This is for symptoms that need immediate medical care. We use bullet lists.

We tailor the heading around the specific condition but always clearly state ‘Call 999 or go to A&E if:’.

<div class="callout callout--info">
  <p><strong>Heading patterns:</strong><br> Call 999 or go to A&E if:<br> Call 999 or go to A&E if you have X and:</p>
</div>

#### Example 1: general emergency box
<div class="example">
  <section class="callout callout--severe">
    <h2>Call 999 or go to <abbr title="Accident and Emergency">A&amp;E</abbr> if you:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>have sudden, severe stomach pain</li>
      <li>have pain when you touch your stomach</li>
      <li>are vomiting blood or a ground coffee like substance</li>
      <li>have bloody or black, sticky poo</li>
      <li>have collapsed</li>
      <li>can’t breathe</li>
      <li>are unable to pee</li>
      <li>are diabetic and vomiting</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
</div>

#### Example 2: emergency box with reason why it’s urgent at the bottom
<div class="example">
  <section class="callout callout--severe">
    <h2>Call 999 or go to <abbr title="Accident and Emergency">A&amp;E</abbr> if:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>you have difficulty swallowing or breathing</li>
      <li>you’re drooling</li>
      <li>your voice changes pitch or becomes wheezy</li>
      <li>your symptoms are severe and getting worse quickly</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These symptoms can make breathing more difficult.</p>
  </section>
</div>

### 111 callout

We currently use the following format and text:

#### Example:
<div class="example">
  <section class="callout callout--muted">
    <h2>Call 111</h2>
    <p>If you can’t speak to your GP or don’t know what to do next.</p>
  </section>
</div>

We have to do more work on this pattern. In user research many people didn’t know what 111 was. We also have
to think about the potential cost of sending everyone to this service before an online version is available.

### General callout box

We use this sparingly for:

* warnings, for example high risk groups for a specific condition
* things that users should act on
* general things to watch out for or do/don’t do

#### Example 1: high risks groups
<div class="example">
  <section class="callout callout--warning">
    <p>Babies, children and the elderly are more at risk of dehydration.</p>
  </section>
</div>

#### Example 2: things to look out for
<div class="example">
  <section class="callout callout--warning">
    <p>General rule: avoid anything that irritates your skin, for example, rubbing it when washing or picking spots.</p>
  </section>
</div>

#### Example 3: avoid callouts right under headings like this one
<div class="example">
  <h3>How much sleep you need</h3>
  <section class="callout callout--warning">
    <p>If you’re constantly tired during the day you don’t get enough sleep.</p>
  </section>
</div>

### Images

We sometimes use images to help users identify symptoms or causes.  

Images should clearly show the symptom. Where possible we also show variations or progression of a condition.

We add a 1 to 2 line caption to each image.

We don’t just put images to ‘enhance’ the page.

#### Example 1: variation of symptoms
<div class="example">

    </figure>
  </div>
</div>

### Comparing 2 things

We use comparison tables where 2 conditions have similar symptoms or where it helps people to compare symptoms.

<div class="callout callout--info">
  <p><strong>Heading pattern:</strong><br> Telling the difference between [condition] and [condition]</p>
</div>

#### Example:
<div class="example">
  <details class="" role="group" open="open">
    <summary data-analytics="summary" role="button" aria-controls="details-content-0" aria-expanded="false">
      <span class="details__summary">Telling the difference between cold and flu</span>
    </summary>
    <div id="details-content-0" aria-hidden="true">
      <p><a href="/conditions/cold#check-if-you-have-a-cold">Cold</a> and flu symptoms are similar but flu tends to be more severe.</p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Flu</th>
            <th>Cold</th>
          </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Appears quickly within a few hours</td>
              <td>Appears gradually</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Affects more than just your nose and throat</td>
              <td>Affects mainly your nose and throat</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Makes you feel exhausted and too unwell to carry on as normal</td>
              <td>Makes you feel unwell but you’re okay to carry on as normal – for example, go to work</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
  </details>
</div>

### Medicines content

We only include very basic medicines information in the condition content:

* what to take, for example painkillers
* how long to take it for
* when you should see a change, for example when the pain should go away

For more detailed information we link to Choices and will be linking to the medicines beta once it’s live.
If no content is available on either these sites we don’t include a link.

### Content for groups that aren’t ‘you’ (children, the elderly etc)

Generally, we address everyone as ‘you’. This includes the general user, carers, older people,
young adults and any other groups.

We only refer to other groups if there are specific actions for them.

We do these things:
* add anchor links to specific sections
* have separate sections for certain groups
* add callout boxes for specific groups

We avoid having separate pages for different groups, for example diarrhoea, diarrhoea in children. So far,
this has worked well. It makes the user journey simpler and future content maintenance more efficient.

#### Example 1: anchor links to direct people to the right bit (the adult and children pages on Choices were merged into one page)
<div class="example">
  <div class="local-header">
    <h1 class="local-header__title">Diarrhoea</h1>
    <div class="local-header__intro">
      <p>Diarrhoea usually goes away on it’s own within a few days. Make sure you or your child drink plenty of fluids.</p>
      <ul class="link-list">
        <li><a href="#how-you-can-treat-diarrhoea-yourself" data-analytics="anchor">Adults with diarrhoea</a></li>
        <li><a href="#babies-and-toddlers-treating-diarrhoea" data-analytics="anchor">Babies and toddlers with diarrhoea</a></li>
        <li><a href="#how-long-diarrhoea-lasts" data-analytics="anchor">How long diarrhoea lasts</a></li>
        <li><a href="#what-causes-diarrhoea" data-analytics="anchor">What causes diarrhoea</a></li>
        <li><a href="#you-cant-always-prevent-diarrhoea" data-analytics="anchor">Preventing diarrhoea</a></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

#### Example 2: treatment for a separate group
<div class="example">
  <h2 id="babies-and-toddlers-treating-diarrhoea">Babies and toddlers: treating diarrhoea</h2>
  <p>
    You can often safely look after your baby or toddler at home. However it’s very important to watch out
    for signs of dehydration.
  </p>
  <p>
    Babies and toddlers can become dehydrated more quickly than older children when they have diarrhoea and
    vomiting. If dehydration becomes severe it can be dangerous, particularly in young babies.
  </p>
  <div class="panel">
    <div class="panel__content panel__content--half">
    <h3 id="do">Do</h3>
    <ul class="list--check">
      <li>
        give them enough to drink in small sips - they
        <a href="/conditions/dehydration#check-if-youre-dehydrated">dehydrate very quickly</a>
      </li>
      <li>continue breastfeeding or formula as normal</li>
      <li>to ease the pain you can give liquid paracetamol for children</li>
      <li>if your child is eating solid foods, offer them their usual food if they want it</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="panel__content panel__content--half">
      <h3 id="dont">Don’t</h3>
      <ul class="list--cross">
        <li>give them medicines to stop the diarrhoea</li>
        <li>give them fruit juice and fizzy drinks (they can make the diarrhoea worse)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

#### Example 3: when to see a GP or get urgent care
<div class="example">
  <section class="callout callout--alert">
    <h2>Take your baby or toddler to the GP urgently if they:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>have a high temperature and you can’t bring it down - over 38C (under 3 months), over 39C (3 to 6 months)</li>
      <li>have blood or mucus in their poo</li>
      <li>have severe tummy pain</li>
      <li>are getting worse quickly</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you can’t get hold of your GP, go to <abbr title="Accident and Emergency">A&amp;E</abbr>.</p>
  </section>
</div>

### Step-by-step lists

Where users should follow a number of actions in a certain order, we use step-by-step lists.

They’re often ‘How to do X’ lists.

We don’t use them just for the sake of it. There should be a definite order behind the steps.

#### Example 1: how to do list
<div class="example">
  <details class="" role="group" open="open">
    <summary data-analytics="summary" role="button" aria-controls="details-content-0" aria-expanded="true">
      <span class="details__summary">How to gargle with salt water</span>
    </summary>
    <div id="details-content-0" aria-hidden="false">
      <ol>
        <li>Dissolve half a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water - warm water helps salt dissolve.</li>
        <li>Gargle with the solution then spit it out - don’t swallow it.</li>
        <li>Repeat as often as you like.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
  </details>
</div>

#### Example 2: treatment list
<div class="example">
  <h2 id="treatment-from-your-gp">Treatment from your GP</h2>
  <p>Broadly, treatment works in 3 main steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Pain relief</strong> - avoid movements that cause you pain. Only move your shoulder gently.
      Use paracetamol or ibuprofen to ease the pain.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Stronger pain and swelling relief</strong> - prescribed painkillers.
      Maybe steroid injections in your shoulder to bring down the swelling.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Getting movement back</strong> - shoulder exercises once it’s less painful.
      This can be at home or with a physiotherapist.
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>

Links should have a clear action. Full stops go outside the link text.

#### Example:

<div class="example">
  <p>
    If you can’t get an appointment, contact 111 or
    <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Service-Search/Walk-in%20centre/LocationSearch/663">go to a walk-in centre</a>.
  </p>
</div>

#### Number of links on a page

We don’t overload pages with links. For example we avoid long link lists to causes.

Instead we meet user needs on the page and give context where we link out, for example by adding the most
common symptoms.

#### Example:
<div class="example">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Discharge</th>
        <th>Possible cause</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>smells fishy</td>
        <td><a href="/conditions/bacterial-vaginosis">bacterial vaginosis</a></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>thick and white (like cottage cheese)</td>
        <td><a href="/conditions/thrush">thrush</a></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>green, yellow or frothy</td>
        <td><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Trichomonas_vaginalis/Pages/Introduction.aspx">trichomoniasis</a></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>with pelvic pain [or bleeding]</td>
        <td>
          <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/chlamydia/Pages/Introduction.aspx">chlamydia</a> or
          <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Gonorrhoea/Pages/Introduction.aspx">gonorrhoea</a>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>with blisters or sores</td>
        <td><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/genital-herpes/Pages/Introduction.aspx">genital herpes</a></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

### Linking out to other organisations

Where other reputable organisations cover bits of content we link out to them instead of duplicating what they do.

For example we link to dietary information on Diabetes UK from our type 2 diabetes guide.
