## Our name

We are NHS.UK. All uppercase.

## Tone

We keep the tone neutral and factual.

We don’t say things like:

* ‘X can be very hard’ - instead we say what you can do about it
* ‘It can take a long time to get an appointment for X’ - instead we say ‘It takes X weeks to get an appointment’

## Reading level

We write for a reading level of about 9 years old.

## Keeping it simple

We keep the content simple. That means action-focused and straightforward. We aim for unambiguous information that
makes it easy for people to take action. This doesn’t mean the content is simplistic. We don’t want to sound condescending.

## Sentence length

We keep sentences short - no longer than 15 to 20 words as a guide.

## Alternative treatments wording

We use:

There is little medical proof that X helps with [condition].

### Example:
<div class="example">
  <div class="callout callout--warning">
    <p>There is little medical evidence that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>what you eat causes acne</li>
      <li>natural remedies help with acne</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

## Bullet lists

### Lead-in sentences

We use a lead-in sentence where needed. For example with Do/Don’t lists there is no need for an intro.

### Style for bullet lists

* lower case
* no commas, semi colons, full stops at the end of a line
* no and/or at the end of a line
* no full sentences

#### Example 1: bullet list with lead-in
<div class="example">
  <p>Some treatments aren’t recommended because they’re unlikely to work:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>products containing permethrin</li>
    <li>head lice “repellents”</li>
    <li>electric head lice combs</li>
    <li>tree and plant oil treatments, such as tea tree oil, eucalyptus oil, and lavender oil herbal remedies</li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### Example 1: Do/Don’t list without lead-in
<div class="example">
  <h3>Do</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>keep the rash clean and dry to reduce risk of infection</li>
    <li>wear loose-fitting clothing</li>
    <li>buy calamine lotion to ease itching</li>
    <li>use a cool compress (a bag of frozen vegetables wrapped in a towel or a wet cloth) a few times a day</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Don’t</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>let dressings or plasters stick to the rash</li>
    <li>use antibiotic cream - this slows healing</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Use call-outs sparingly

We don’t overdo it with the call outs. Users ignore them if there are too many. We also avoid ‘call-out competition’
where one call out follows another or they’re right under a heading.


## Connecting to services

We keep the language user-focused. Users don’t care which part of the NHS a service falls under.
They just want to book or find it.


### Example 1: pharmacy
<div class="example">
  <p>You can buy these from a pharmacy without a prescription</p>
  <section class="callout callout--info callout--compact">
    <div class="reading-width">
      <p><a href="/finders/find-help">Find a pharmacy</a></p>
    </div>
  </section>
</div>

### Example 2: sexual health clinic
<div class="example">
  <section class="callout callout--info callout--compact">
    <div class="reading-width">
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/service-search/Sexual-health-information-and-support/LocationSearch/734">
          Find a sexual health clinic
        </a>
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>
</div>

## etc. or giving examples?

We don’t use etc. Instead we try to be specific or use ‘include’.


### Example:
<div class="example">
  <p>Other things that can cause indigestion include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>medicines</li>
    <li>smoking</li>
    <li>alcohol</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## For example, e.g. or eg

We use for example, not e.g. or eg

## Headers and subheaders

For conditions the title is usually the condition name.

Sub-headers: we make these active so that the user can get the gist by scanning the page or knows what bits to
read for their particular circumstances.

### Examples:
<div class="example">
  <h3>Check if you have conjunctivitis</h3>
  <h3>How to treat conjunctivitis yourself</h3>
  <h3>Stop infectious conjunctivitis from spreading</h3>
</div>

## High temperature or fever?

We use:

* a high temperature of 38C or above

We don’t just use fever.

## ‘Like’ or ‘such as’?

We use both and do what feels right in each case.  

## Linking to content with more medical detail

We have tried this on a few pages. In user research not many people followed the link. We will refine this
pattern further and put it through user research.

### Example:
<div class="example">
  <a href="http://cks.nice.org.uk/head-lice#!diagnosissub">Medical detail about head lice</a>
</div>

## m-dash or to?

We use ‘to’ for all times and quantities.

### Examples:
<div class="example">
  <p>The surgery is open from 2pm to 6pm.</p>
  <p>Take 2 to 4 tablets a day.</p>
</div>

## Medical names and plain English

We use medical names for search engine optimisation but explain them where they’re not commonly known.

For example: piles (haemorrhoids)

We don’t use any medical jargon. Instead we use plain English throughout.

## Numbers

We use numerals for all numbers (including 1 to 9) when it refers to amounts and time.

We use ‘one’ in running text or phrases.

### Example 1: amounts and time
<div class="example">
  <p>It can take 1 to 4 days for the medication to work.</p>
  <p>Take 1 to 2 paracetamol every 2 hours.</p>
</div>

### Example 2: running text
<div class="example">
  <p>One of the options you have is to see your GP.</p>
  <p>Choose one of the following. </p>
</div>

## Relieve, help with, ease the pain

We use:

* relieve pain
* help with pain
* ease the pain


## Table format

We do them like this:

* column 1 starts with caps
* column 2, 3, 4…, we use lower case

### Example:
<div class="example">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Dizziness symptoms</th>
        <th>Possible causes</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>When standing or sitting up suddenly</td>
        <td>sudden <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Blood-pressure-(low)/Pages/Introduction.aspx">drop in blood pressure</a> (postural hypotension)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          Feeling off-balance, losing some hearing, ringing or other sounds in your ears
          (<a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/tinnitus/Pages/Introduction.aspx">tinnitus</a>)
        </td>
        <td>inner-ear problems</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Feeling off-balance or like things are spinning, feeling or being sick, sometimes after a cold or flu</td>
        <td><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/labyrinthitis/Pages/Introduction.aspx">labyrinthitis</a></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>After starting new prescription medicine</td>
        <td>side effect of medication</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>With symptoms like hearing loss, double vision, blurred vision, numb face, arms or legs</td>
        <td>
          decreased blood flow to the brain, possibly from clogged arteries
          (<a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/atherosclerosis/Pages/Introduction.aspx">atherosclerosis</a>)
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

## Times

We haven’t used times very much so far but follow this format:

6 hours 30 minutes

We don’t use:

* 6.5 hours
* 6 and a half hours

## ‘Usually’ or ‘normally’?

We mostly use ‘usually’. ‘Normally’ in a health context can give a sense that something isn’t normal.
