We use [agile delivery](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery#phases-of-an-agile-project) to design and make NHS.UK services and products. Our work is assessed against the gov.uk [Digital Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard).

You must design services and products which meet the following points of the Digital Service Standard:

* <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/understand-user-needs">point 1 - Understand user needs</a>
* <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/do-ongoing-user-research">point 2 - Do ongoing user research</a>
* <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/use-agile-methods">point 4 - Use agile methods</a>
