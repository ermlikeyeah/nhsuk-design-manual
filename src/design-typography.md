#### Font

NHS.UK uses Frutiger. The fallback from Frutiger is Arial.

Our typographic scale for headings and body type creates clear structure and consistency for users. We have a
recommended scale for larger and smaller devices.

#### Body

Baseline font size is 20px with a line-height of 32px. Paragraphs are spaced an additional 16px apart.

#### The measure

‘The measure’ is the number of characters in a single line of a column of text. In body text you should aim for
between 45 and 75 characters per line. This makes reading easier because the eye doesn’t have to work as hard to move
from the end of one line to the start of the next line.

The measure is usually handled by the grid. With our baseline font size of 20pt, for larger viewports, type set to
two-thirds of the screen width should be within 45 and 75 characters. Always check.

#### Headings

There are currently 2 type scales for large viewports (such as desktop browser windows) and small viewports
(like mobile browser windows).

##### Heading scale in large viewports
