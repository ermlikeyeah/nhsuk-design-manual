We use images to help people validate their symptoms. All our images are cropped at a ratio of 3:2.

#### Example
<div class="example">
  <img src="assets/units/image.png" alt="Image cropped at 3 by 2 ratio">
</div>  

#### Image with caption

We use captions to describe the symptom to give more context where needed.

#### Example
<div class="example">
  <img src="assets/units/figcaption.png" alt="Image with caption text">
</div>
