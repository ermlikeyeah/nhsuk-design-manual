## 17. Identify performance indicators and report performance data in the open

Identify performance indicators for the service, including the [4 mandatory key performance indicators](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success/sharing-your-data-with-the-performance-platform#meeting-the-digital-service-standard)
(KPIs) defined in the [GDS Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual). Establish a benchmark for each metric
and make a plan to enable improvements.
