At this stage, NHS.UK uses a reduced colour palette, taken from [NHS brand guidelines](https://www.england.nhs.uk/nhsidentity/identity-guidelines/colours/).
There have been 2 modifications to this palette:

**Greens**<br> We use a shade of the existing secondary green. This colour is used on some navigational elements,
such as buttons. A darker green meets accessibility requirements when white button text is used.

**Greys**<br> Greys have been extended to produce a 5-step scale. This gives a wider range and more flexibility.
Lighter greys are used as backgrounds for some callout panels that also comply with AA and AAA WCAG contrast guidelines.
