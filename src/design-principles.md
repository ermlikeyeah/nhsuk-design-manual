title: NHS.UK design principles
description: We are in the process of establishing a set of design principles. This is a piece of collaborative work between NHS.UK teams, spanning content, design and development.
breadcrumb_2_name: Design principles

## Why principles?

### They’re a standard we can judge our work against.

Working to principles provides a foundation on which to build services. Health journeys are complex, with many
touch points. Solid principles will help us steer our work through this complexity.

### They tie values with execution.
Principles help us place [NHS values](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-nhs-constitution-for-england/the-nhs-constitution-for-england#nhs-values)
at the heart of the services we build.

### They help us to be consistent.
Principles promote a consistent vision across different teams, different locations and different stages of a product
or service’s life cycle.

These principles will form part of the design guidelines across NHS.UK. Like all work, they will be constantly
refined and iterated.

## 1. Start with needs

The needs of patients and the NHS staff who support them shape the services we build.

## 2. Don’t get in the way

Health journeys are complex. Our services are for everyone. Nobody should be excluded, discriminated against or left
behind. Don’t hinder users with anything that increases friction. Elegance comes from doing the most with the least,
being simple without being simplistic.

## 3. Look around and ahead

Think about the service in as wide a context as possible. Understand the end to end journey and where it connects with
other services. Think about it now, think about how it might be 10 years from now.

## 4. Continually improve

Always seek to understand user behaviour so we can iterate and improve our services.

<a name="5"></a>
## 5. Be honest and open

Be honest and open in everything that we do. It improves services and preserves trust. People trust the NHS,
we should never abuse this trust.

<a name="6"></a>
## 6. Design together

Collaborate. Design with others. Involve your team whatever their role, involve other designers, involve users, involve stakeholders. Use design to cut across silos by designing together.

<a name="7"></a>
## 7. Be consistent, not uniform
We should use the same language and the same design patterns wherever possible. This helps people get familiar with our services, but when this isn’t possible we should make sure our approach is consistent.

This isn’t a straitjacket or a rule book. Every circumstance is different. When we find patterns that work we should share them, and talk about why we use them. But that shouldn’t stop us from improving or changing them in the future when we find better ways of doing things or the needs of users change.
