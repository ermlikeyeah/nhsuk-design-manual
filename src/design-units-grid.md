The NHS grid is a flexible 16 column grid, that has percentage-based columns and gutters. It expands to a maximum width
of 960px. At sizes above 960px the grid is centrally aligned.

#### Baseline grid

A baseline grid of 8px is used to create regular vertical spacing between objects down a page. This baseline allows us
to space our text, images or any other page elements consistently.


### Spacing and layout

The grid uses fixed margins and gutters to help control the proportion and balance of the page. The margins and gutters
are set to 16px for small screens and 32px for larger screens.

Any number of columns can be used to suit the content and create layouts at different widths. At this stage,
we predominantly use the two-thirds/one-third layout.

For layouts intended for use on smaller screens, we recommend using a maximum of 4 columns.

#### Breakpoints

Breakpoints are the point at which the content responds to different screen features, for example, screen sizes.
For simplicity, we are using 2 width breakpoints, resulting in three layouts.

##### Small, medium and large breakpoints
