### How we write intros

This is the white text in the blue header. Intros are also the metadata description that people will see on Google.

We include 1 or 2 important facts about the topic. The prioritised user needs can help with choosing what’s important.

Things we include are:

* reassurance, for example how common a condition is
* what you can do yourself
* when to see someone about the condition

It can help to write intros last once you know the topic.  

#### Examples:
<div class="example">
  <div class="local-header">
    <h1 class="local-header__title">Hand, foot and mouth disease</h1>
    <div class="local-header__intro">
      <p>
        Hand, foot and mouth disease is a common childhood illness that can affect adults. It usually
        clears up by itself in 7 to 10 days.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="example">
  <div class="local-header">
    <h1 class="local-header__title">Hernia</h1>
    <div class="local-header__intro">
      <p>A hernia looks like a lump under the skin. It can be different sizes.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

### Writing about symptoms

We keep the content practical and focused on signs people can check themselves. This is usually a bullet list of
symptoms that’s easy to scan. We avoid including any other information, for example about causes and treatments
in the symptoms section.

We include images where this helps people identify their symptoms.

Not every condition needs a section on symptoms. This depends on the user needs.

We have done the following:

* where it’s obvious or where we’re writing about a symptom, for example sore throat, we haven’t included
  a symptoms’ section
* where there is only one action (for example, see a GP) we have combined symptoms and [GP box](#example-1-see-a-gp)

<div class="callout callout--info">
  <p><strong>Heading pattern:</strong><br> Check if you have [condition]</p>
</div>

#### Example 1: bullet list easy to scan
<div class="example">
  <h2 id="check-if-you-have-flu">Check if you have flu</h2>
  <p>Flu symptoms come on very quickly and can include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a sudden fever - a temperature of 38C or above</li>
    <li>aching body</li>
    <li>feeling tired or exhausted</li>
    <li>dry, chesty cough</li>
    <li>sore throat</li>
    <li>headache</li>
    <li>difficulty sleeping</li>
    <li>loss of appetite</li>
    <li>diarrhoea or tummy pain</li>
    <li>nausea and being sick</li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### Example 2: combined See a GP box and symptoms list
<div class="example">
  <div class="local-header">
    <h1 class="local-header__title">Bacterial vaginosis</h1>
    <div class="local-header__intro">
      <p>
        Bacterial vaginosis is a common infection of the vagina. It’s harmless and easily treated with antibiotics.
        It’s not classed as a sexually transmitted infection (STI).

#### Example 3: identifying symptoms using images
<div class="example">
  <h2 id="check-if-you-have-shingles">Check if you have shingles</h2>
  <p>The first sign of shingles can be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a tingling or painful feeling in an area of skin</li>
    <li>a headache or feeling generally unwell</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A rash will appear a few days later.</p>
  <p>Usually you get shingles on your chest and tummy, but it can appear on your face, eyes and genitals.</p>

### Conditions with similar symptoms

We include these conditions under a reveal link. If there are a few of them we put these in a table with
their main symptoms.

The aim is to always make it easy for people to pick the condition they think applies to them.

<div class="callout callout--info">
  <p><strong>Heading pattern:</strong><br> If you’re not sure it’s [condition]</p>
</div>

#### Example 1: running text
<div class="example">

    <summary data-analytics="summary" role="button" aria-controls="details-content-0" aria-expanded="true">
      <span class="details__summary">If you’re not sure it’s cellulitis</span>
    </summary>
    <div id="details-content-0" aria-hidden="false">

### Writing about treatment in general

Whenever possible we include how long it will usually take to get better.

### Writing about self-care

We focus on things users can do easily themselves and don’t need any help from a clinician.

We often use Do/Don’t lists to give people clear actions.

<div class="callout callout--info">
  <p><strong>Heading pattern:</strong><br> How you can treat [condition] yourself</p>
</div>

#### Example 1: running text

<div class="example">
  <h2>How you can treat earwax build-up yourself</h2>
  <section class="callout callout--warning">
    <p>
      Don’t use your fingers or any objects like cotton buds to remove the earwax. This will push it further
      in and make it worse.
    </p>
  </section>
  <p>
    Usually earwax falls out on its own. If it doesn’t and blocks your ear, put 2 to 3 drops of olive or almond oil in
    your ear twice a day for a few days. Over a week or 2 weeks large lumps of earwax can fall out of your ear,
    especially at night when you’re lying down.
  </p>
  <p>There is no proof that ear candles or ear vacuums get rid of earwax.</p>
</div>

#### Example 2: Do/Don’t list

<div class="example">
  <p>You can help to prevent styes with some simple hygiene measures.</p>
  <div class="panel">
    <div class="panel__content panel__content--half">
      <h3 id="do">Do</h3>
      <ul class="list--check">
        <li>wash your face and remove eye makeup before bed</li>
        <li>replace your eye makeup every 6 months</li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Blepharitis/Pages/Treatment.aspx">
            keep your eyelids and eyelashes clean
          </a> - especially if you have blepharitis
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="panel__content panel__content--half">
      <h3 id="dont">Don’t</h3>
      <ul class="list--cross">
        <li>share towels or flannels with someone who has a stye</li>
        <li>rub your eyes if you haven’t recently washed your hands</li>
        <li>put contact lenses in before washing your hands</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

### Writing about treatment from the pharmacy

We use this section for:

* help people can get from a pharmacist
* products they should ask for if there are specific ones (for example for acne)
* information about how long it takes before the medication works (if we know)
* practical information about talking to the pharmacist about a condition (for example if it’s something people
  might find embarrassing)

We don’t include detailed information about the medicines. Instead we link to Choices and will be linking to the
medicines beta once this has gone live.

We say you can buy medicines from your pharmacy.  We don’t use ‘without prescription’ or ‘over-the-counter’.

We always include a link to the pharmacy finder.

<div class="callout callout--info">
  <p><strong>Heading pattern:</strong><br> Your pharmacist can help with [condition]</p>
  <p><strong>Pharmacy link text pattern:</strong><br> [Find a pharmacy](https://beta.nhs.uk/finders/find-help)</p>
</div>

#### Example 1: practical information and timings
<div class="example">
  <h2>Your pharmacist can help with earwax build-up</h2>
  <p>To dissolve the earwax you can buy chemical drops from a pharmacy.</p>
  <p>The earwax should fall out on its own or dissolve after about a week.</p>
  <p>Don’t use drops if you have a hole in your eardrum. Ask your pharmacist what you can do instead.</p>
  <section class="callout callout--info callout--compact">
    <div class="reading-width">
      <p><a href="/finders/find-help">Find a pharmacy</a></p>
    </div>
  </section>
</div>

#### Example 2: asking for specific products
<div class="example">
  <h2>Your pharmacist can help with heat rash</h2>
  <p>To help soothe sore and itchy skin you can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>use calamine lotion</li>
    <li>use hydrocortisone cream (but not on the face)</li>
    <li>take antihistamine tablets (but speak to a pharmacist first as they’re not always appropriate)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You can buy these from a pharmacy. The pharmacist can advise you on the best medicines to use,
    for example if you’re pregnant or a child has the rash.
  </p>
  <section class="callout callout--info callout--compact">
    <p><a href="/finders/find-help">Find a pharmacy</a></p>
  </section>
</div>

#### Example 3: information about talking to a pharmacist
<div class="example">
  <p>
    Pharmacists can give you advice about which product is best for you. Ask your pharmacist if you can speak to them
    in a private area if you’re embarrassed.
  </p>
</div>

### Writing about the GP appointment and treatment from a GP

We add information about what happens at the appointment when:

* people need to prepare for the appointment in any way
* the GP might do tests that could be intrusive in any way, for example UTIs, STIs


We add information about treatment from the GP when:

* there is a user need to know the specific type of treatment
* there is a common treatment for the condition


There is more information about GP treatment in the [GP box](#example-1-see-a-gp) section.

#### Example 1: GP appointments
<div class="example">
  <h2>What happens at your appointment</h2>
  <p>You’ll be asked about your symptoms and may need to give a urine sample to confirm you have a UTI.</p>
  <p>A urine test helps to rule out other conditions that might be causing your symptoms.</p>
  <p>
    Men are sometimes offered a painless swab test to check for other conditions.
    This is where a cotton bud is wiped on the tip of the penis and sent for testing.
  </p>
  <p>This won’t hurt, but may feel uncomfortable.</p>
</div>

#### Example 2: GP treatment
<div class="example">
  <h2>Treatment from your GP</h2>
  <p>Broadly, treatment works in 3 main steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Pain relief</strong> - avoid movements that cause you pain. Only move your shoulder gently.
      Use paracetamol or ibuprofen to ease the pain.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Stronger pain and swelling relief</strong> - prescribed painkillers.
      Maybe steroid injections in your shoulder to bring down the swelling.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Getting movement back</strong> - shoulder exercises once it’s less painful.
      This can be at home or with a physiotherapist.
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>

### Writing about causes

We only include a causes section if there is a specific user need. For example, people want to know why they
have insomnia.

In user research the most common reasons given for wanting to know about causes were:

* reassurance - people want to put a name to the thing they have
* validation - people want to confirm what they suspect they have
* it normalises the condition
* treatment options - when you know what it might be you can focus on what to do about it and whether
  you need to worry or not

We always try and give causes within a context. We include:

* the most common causes and their symptoms
* reveal links for other (less common) causes where appropriate
* links to conditions that can be a cause

We avoid long link lists of causes as they’re not helpful and encourage self-diagnosis.

<div class="callout callout--info">
  <p><strong>Heading pattern:</strong><br> What causes [condition]</p>
</div>

#### Example 1: symptoms information puts causes into context

#### Example 3: causes information that’s linked to prevention
<div class="example">
  <h2>Causes of UTIs</h2>
  <p>
    UTIs are usually caused by bacteria from poo entering the urinary tract.
    The bacteria enters through the tube that carries pee out of the body (urethra).
  </p>
  <p>
    Women have a shorter urethra than men. This means bacteria is more likely to reach the bladder
    or kidneys and cause an infection.
  </p>
  <p>Causes of UTIs include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>pregnancy</li>
    <li>
      conditions that block the urinary tract - such as
      <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/kidney-stones/Pages/Introduction.aspx">kidney stones</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      conditions that make it difficult to fully empty the bladder - such as an
      <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Prostate-enlargement/Pages/Introduction.aspx">enlarged prostate gland</a>
      in men and <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/conditions/constipation">constipation</a> in children
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/urinary-catheterization/Pages/Introduction.aspx">urinary catheters</a>
      (a tube in your bladder used to drain urine)

### How common a cause is

We are still working on this pattern and haven’t yet published the example below. Our clinician thinks that in its
current format it’s too definitive and would give a wrong impression.

However, we know from research that users want to know things like ‘do I have cancer’ and how likely that is.
Likeliness can be a very helpful indicator to put causes into context.

#### Example 5: how common a cause is
<div class="example">
  <h2>What causes coughs</h2>
  <p>Most coughs are caused by cold or flu.</p>
  <p>Other causes include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>smoking</li>
    <li>allergies, for example hay fever</li>
    <li>infections like bronchitis</li>
    <li>mucus dripping down the throat from the back of the nose</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A cough is very rarely a sign of something serious like lung cancer.</p>
</div>

### Writing about prevention

We only include this information where there is a user need. We give users practical self-care information.

Where there is a specific need to prevent something from spreading we spell this out.

In user research people’s attention was drawn to Do/Don’t lists. They found them easy to scan and act on.

<div class="callout callout--info">
  <p><strong>Heading patterns:</strong><br> Preventing [condition]<br> You can’t always prevent [condition]</p>
</div>

#### Example 1: stop a condition from spreading
<div class="example">
  <h2>Stop infectious conjunctivitis from spreading</h2>
  <div class="panel">
    <div class="panel__content panel__content--half">
      <h3 id="do">Do</h3>
      <ul class="list--check">
        <li>wash hands regularly with warm soapy water</li>
        <li>wash pillows and face cloths in hot water and detergent</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="panel__content panel__content--half">
      <h3 id="dont">Don’t</h3>
      <ul class="list--cross">
        <li>wear contact lenses until your eyes are better</li>
        <li>share towels and pillows</li>
        <li>rub your eyes</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

#### Example 2: stop a condition from recurring
<div class="example">
  <div class="panel">
    <div class="panel__content panel__content--half">
      <h3 id="do">Do</h3>
      <ul class="list--check">
        <li>wash your face and remove eye makeup before bed</li>
        <li>replace your eye makeup every 6 months</li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Blepharitis/Pages/Treatment.aspx">
            keep your eyelids and eyelashes clean
          </a> - especially if you have blepharitis
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
      <div class="panel__content panel__content--half">
        <h3 id="dont">Don’t</h3>
        <ul class="list--cross">
          <li>share towels or flannels with someone who has a stye</li>
          <li>rub your eyes if you haven’t recently washed your hands</li>
          <li>put contact lenses in before washing your hands</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
  </div>
</div>

### Writing about pain

Pain is often a benchmark of when to go and see a GP. When we started the project we used descriptions like ‘severe’
but found in user research that people struggle to understand what that means.

We now use plainer descriptions like:

* very painful
* you’re in a lot of pain
* extremely painful

We need to do more user research around this pattern. We are looking for better ways to help people describe how
bad their pain is. One idea could be a digital version of the 1 to 10 pain scale that doctors use.

#### Example 1: very painful
<div class="example">
  <section class="callout callout--attention">
    <h2>See a GP if your stye:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>is very painful or swollen</li>
      <li>doesn’t get better within a few weeks</li>
      <li>affects your vision</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
</div>

#### Example 2: in a lot of pain
<div class="example">
  <section class="callout callout--attention">
    <h2>Go to a minor injuries unit or your GP if:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>the injury isn’t feeling any better within a few days</li>
      <li>you’re still in a lot of pain and can’t put weight on the injured joint</li>
      <li>you can’t move the joint or muscle</li>
      <li>the injury is numb, discoloured or cold to touch</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
</div>

#### Example 3: extremely painful

<div class="example">
  <section class="callout callout--severe">
    <div class="reading-width">
      <h2>Call 999 or go to <abbr title="Accident and Emergency">A&amp;E</abbr> if you:</h2>
      <p>You hurt your head badly, for example from a fall or accident.</p>
      <p>It feels like the worst pain you’ve ever had and came on suddenly.</p>
    </div>
  </section>
</div>
